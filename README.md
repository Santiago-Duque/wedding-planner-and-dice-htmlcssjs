Wedding Planner Testing: I created an html file to display the wedding questions in the prompts.

CSS Techniques: Changed background-color (line 14), changed text color (line 30, 34), added font weights (line 29, 36) -non CSS includes changes to buttons, headers, icons-

Optimal Wedding Planner: Added calculations accounting for an as-even-as-possible distribution between guests and tables using divisions and modulos (line 4, 5). Distributions follow optimal distribution examples provided in write-up.
